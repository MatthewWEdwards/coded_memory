In this section, we present the analysis of schemes introduced in the above sections. The analysis is divided in to two parts: the first part presents a tabular format of the benefits and cost for each of the sub-scheme. In the second section, we present the performance results obtained by processing the address traces shared by Huawei. \\ 
Table~\ref{table:benefit_cost} presents the benefits and cost of each of the sub-scheme. It essentially presents the summary of the analysis done in the previous sections where we introduced each of these schemes. The condensed tabular format can be used to compare the cost and benefits of each of the sub-schemes.
