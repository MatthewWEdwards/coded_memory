This phase of the project explores use of coding techniques to the memory systems. Various code designs for the system are explored. We propose techniques of dynamically coding a localized high frequency access region and prefetching the data / codes to increase the efficiency of the system. For given design parameters, we explore 4 read accesses and 2 write accesses per bank per cycle.
