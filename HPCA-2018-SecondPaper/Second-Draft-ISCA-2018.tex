\comment{
\section{HBM details: removed from background sections}

% Each HBM channel is expected to provide a 128-bit data interface that supports up to 1-2 Gbps of data rate per signal equivalent to 500-1000MHz of DDR memory. This is equivalent to 16-32 GB/sec of bandwidth per channel. With 8 channels stacked together it can provide 128-256 GB/sec of access bandwidth per stack. 

% The HBM specification document lists two modes of operation: legacy mode and pseudo channel mode. A memory controller can support either the legacy or the pseudo channel mode. 

% In case of the legacy mode, each read or write transaction transfers 256 bits in a burst that consists of 2 cycles of 128 bits each. In pseudo channel mode, the 128-bit bus is split into 2 individual 64-bit segments. On each segment, a read or write transaction transfers 256 bits as well, but in a burst that lasts 4 cycles (of 64 bits each). The pseudo channel conceptually divides the memory of a single channel in half and assigns each half to a fixed pseudo channel. The pseudo channels share the same address and command bus: you can send a command and addresses to one pseudo channel or the other, but not to both.
