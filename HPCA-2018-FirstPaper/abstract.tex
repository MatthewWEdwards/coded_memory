Memory systems work hard to keep up with access requests from cores. Growing computer sizes, heterogenous systems and increasing level of integration has increased more. Performance focussed systems use enhancements like multi-port memories to increase the access capacity. However, they come with a cost in terms of area, complexity and cost of redesign and rebuilding a system. In this paper, we explore a mathematical solution to the problem where we explore an efficient memory storage and reterival mechanism for efficent access. We first analyze the request pattern of general memory controller and a application-specific memory controller. \\
We then provide a mathematical approach to storing the data in specific way to achieve higher access rate. We call this specific way of storing the memory as Algorithmic Memory. We discuss methods to design codes and provide example designs for 8 bank memory systems. \\
At last, we analyze and compare the improvement of coded memory with general memory. We present a significant improvement in critical word read and write latency with coded memory. We also provide intuitions derived from this analysis which can help the system designers to efficiently use Algorithmic memory implementation.
