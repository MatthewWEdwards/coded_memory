\begin{abstract}
Many performance critical systems today must rely on performance enhancements, such as multi-port memories, to keep up with the increasing demand of memory-access capacity. However, the large area footprints and complexity of existing multi-port memory designs limit their applicability in practice. This paper explores a coding theoretic framework to address this problem. In particular, this paper introduces a framework to encode data across multiple single-port memory banks in order to {\em algorithmically} realize the functionality of multi-port memory.

This paper proposes three code designs with significant less storage overhead compared to the existing replication based emulations of multi-port memories. To further improve performance, we also demonstrate a memory controller design that utilizes redundancy across coded memory banks to more efficiently schedule read and write requests sent across multiple cores. Furthermore, guided by real-life traces, the paper explores two potential directions to improve the efficiency of the coding based memory design: 1) {\em Dynamic coding}, and 2) {\em Prefetching}. We then show significant performance improvements in critical word read and write latency in the proposed coded-memory design when compared to a traditional uncoded-memory design. \Ethan{real-life, PARSEC, or both?}

%{\color{red}\textbf{Coding over small number of banks:~}In order to save storage space allocated to different pointers.....This is something which does not arise in many classical scenarios where coding is employed. For example, in communications, it is preferable to encode over long messages as apart from computational complexity as in most cases there is no additional penalty (proportional to the code length) in terms of pointers required to deal with write requests.}

%In this part, we attempt to design efficient codes based on the memory traces 
%shared by Huawei.  The goal of this design was to simulate the efficiency of 
%coding and compare the results to the baseline implementation of not coding.  
%During this design phase, we explored various code functions that could be used 
%to create the codes on the stored data. We decide upon using the XOR function to 
%store the data in the parity banks because of its low complexity overhead and 
%for preserving the linearity of codes. Linear codes offer the widest range of 
%functionality because any order of the codes may be used to either encode or 
%decode. This lack of dependency allows our design to use the parity banks in the 
%most flexible way possible. We also explore the potential benefits of using 
%different weights to the memory elements for the XOR function. For examples, the 
%memory elements $a_0$ and $b_0$ could be stored as $\alpha a_0 + \beta b_0$ for 
%integer values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ which belong to any Galois Field. The 
%least complex design for the decoder would be for taking $\alpha$ = 1 and 
%$\beta$ = 1 . Another design consideration explored is the compression factor to 
%generate the codes.  The codes can be generated by using xor on 2 or more memory 
%elements. For example, suppose there are four banks A, B , C and D. Each of the 
%banks hold $a_0$ to $a_n$, $b_0$ to $b_n$ , $c_0$ to $c_n$ and $d_0$ to $d_n$ 
%elements respectively. The possible codes for these memories could be:
%\begin{equation}
%a_i + b_i, b_i + c_i, c_i + d_i \text{ and } c_i + a_i  \text{ for i = 0 to n }
%\end{equation}
%This scheme uses the combination of 2 memory elements to generate the codes.  
%Although this requires 100$\%$ extra memory overhead, it enables 100$\%$ extra 
%memory accesses per cycle, i.e., 4 extra accesses in this case.
%Another design could be to compress the codes by combining all 4 memory elements 
%to generate the codes:
%\begin{equation}
%a_i + b_i + c_i + d_i \text{ for i = 0 to n }
%\end{equation}
%This design gives one extra access per cycle at the cost of 25$\%$ memory 
%overhead. However, the decoder here needs to know 3 elements to be able to 
%decode the 4th element. So although we are able to compress more data into a 
%single memory location, it comes with the cost of additional memory logic.  The 
%scheme described above "codes" the memory banks using elements from different 
%banks. We call this type of coding as Interbank Coding. We also explore the 
%orthogonal way of coding, i.e. intra-bank coding where we use the memory 
%elements from the same bank to generate codes.
