% Various code designs for the system are explored. 

%We propose techniques of dynamically coding a localized high frequency access region and algorithm to efficiently schedule memory accesses. For given design parameters, we design codes capable of doing 4 simultaneous reads per bank per cycle or 2 simultaneous writes per bank per cycle. The algorithms are implemented using systemC and are simulated using memory access traces for multi-core systems.
